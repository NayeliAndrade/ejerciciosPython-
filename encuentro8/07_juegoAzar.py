has to guess it. The program structure is as follows:
1st) The program randomly chooses a number n between 1 and 10.
2ยบ) The user enters a number x.
3ยบ) If x is not the exact number, the program indicates whether n is larger or smaller than the number entered.
4ยบ) We repeat from 2) until x is equal to n.
The program has to print the appropriate messages to tell the user what to do and what happened until he/she
